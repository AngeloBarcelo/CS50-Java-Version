# CS50 Java version

Here I am trying all of the problems from CS50 in Java. Still working on how I want to organize this.
What I want to do is complete all of the problems then in the main class ask the user what problem they would like to see and how they would like to see it (termianl window or GUI). 

Still working out if I each problem will be in its own class and then called from the pset week or each pset week will have all of the problems then called from main.
